ToDo:

	Errors:
	Implement error handling, exit status and error messages in execution

	Signals:
	CtrlC && Ctrl\ in exec... stop all children?
	CtrlC in HERE_DOC MUST SET EXIT_STATUS TO 1
	
	Builtin Export:
	Parse
	When finding += must append instead of trunc
	Export without = saves in export
	Export without arguments and options shows env in ascii order.

	Build different expansor for here_doc case
